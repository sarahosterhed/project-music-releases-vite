# Music Releases

The assignment was to build a site in React displaying music releases and fetch that data from a provided json-file.

## Getting Started with the Project
We started with defining the different components, structuring the site and creating a file-structure.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
